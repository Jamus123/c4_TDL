This project was a font-end chrome extension application that I helped manage the code repository for. I was the group leader and did all manual merging, handling of pull requests and also creating and resolving issues to organize the project.

This project used jQuery, and AJAX to connect to already coded back-end which allowed our group to save and manage current tasks.

The code base for this project can be found at https://github.com/LandedE/c4_TDL which is one of my group members repositories.

Please refer to my commit history from June 2nd to June 5th to see examples of the project that I manage.
